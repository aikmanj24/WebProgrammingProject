    <p style="background-color:#8CB9BC;">A little about me-- I'm from Dallas, Texas and have just finished my first Semester at Washington and Lee University where I took my first programming class. I see the concepts of coding which I've learned in the class being useful to me in the future, as I am interested in studying design.</p>
